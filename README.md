This repository holds python code that scrapes vacation info from geoapify API and creates maps of travel destinations based on ideal weather conditions. All the files here were completed for the Challenge 6 Assignment for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp. All of the data used was provided by edX, and I adapted the code provided by edX with the help of the Xpert Learning Assisstant.
